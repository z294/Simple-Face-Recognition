# Simple-Face-Recognition
I created simple Face Recognition after watching a YouTube tutorial using openCV. 

- takes in a folder of known faces in jpeg format. 
- If a match exists, a green box will highlight the face and the name associated with the face.
- If a match does not exist, a red box will highlight the face.
